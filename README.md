#  CUDI SafePay: AI Agent for Gasless, Private Payments

##  Project Overview

**CUDI SafePay** is the next-generation financial assistant designed to eliminate friction and complexity from decentralized payments. Our mission is to provide creators, journalists, and everyday users with a **secure, simple, and censorship-resistant** way to move value globally.

The project is built on the secure financial infrastructure of **Circle** and the **Arc Layer-1 blockchain**.

##  Core Value Proposition

We solve the two biggest problems in digital finance: **complexity** (Web3) and **censorship** (traditional platforms).

### 1. The Bulut Agent (AI Simplicity)

Our conversational AI assistant, **Bulut** (meaning 'Cloud'), allows users to manage money using only natural language commands.

* **Write, Don't Tap:** Users can initiate payments or subscriptions by simply typing a phrase (e.g., "Pay 20 USDC to @friend for dinner," or "Activate monthly subscription").


### 2. Frictionless Payments (0% Hassle)

CUDI SafePay offers features that make payments easier and safer than traditional banking:

| Feature | User Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gasless Transactions** | Payments are **100% network fee-free** for the sender. This is made possible by the **Arc Paymaster** functionality. |
| **No Seed Phrase** | Secure onboarding via **PIN or Biometrics**. We use **Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets** to eliminate the risk of losing funds through a seed phrase. |
| **Bizum 3.0 P2P** | Use simple **@aliases** for instant fund transfers and **Safe Requests** (split payments), making payments as easy as sending a text. |
| **Smart Subscriptions** | Users manage **recurring payments** and RWA access (e.g., digital courses) via auditable Smart Contracts on the Arc network. |

##  Technology Stack

CUDI SafePay is built using modern, highly performant technologies:

* **Frontend:** Flutter (Mobile/Web UX)
* **Backend/AI:** Python (FastAPI) and **Cloudflare Workers AI** (for low-latency NLP inference)
* **Blockchain:** **Arc L1** (Settlement & USDC Gas) and **Circle Developer Wallets** (Security)
